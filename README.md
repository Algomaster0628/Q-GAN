## Introduction
Q-GAN is a project aimed at building a Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (Q-GAN) and testing it on various datasets to generate new images. Additionally, we are exploring the implementation of Q-GAN in the Quaternion domain for potentially enhanced performance.

## Overview
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown remarkable success in generating realistic data, including images, text, and music. Q-GAN extends this concept into the quantum realm, leveraging principles of quantum computing to potentially achieve even better results. By harnessing the power of quantum mechanics, Q-GAN aims to generate high-quality images with improved efficiency and fidelity.

## Project Goals
1. Implement a Quantum Generative Adversarial Network.
2. Test the Q-GAN on different datasets to generate new images.
3. Explore the implementation of Q-GAN in the Quaternion domain.
4. Evaluate the performance of Q-GAN compared to classical GANs.
5. Document the findings and insights gained from the project.
